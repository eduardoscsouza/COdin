# COdin
A FLOSS Machine-Learning library written in C

## About
The goal of our project is to build a education-friendly neural network to help newcomers to understand the
concepts of a neural network in an easier way. The language of choice is C because we want to build the concepts from
the ground up, and C is a powerful, simple and popular programming language.

## How to start contributing
Learn about artificial neural networks, the mathematics behind it and common implementation techniques. We
recommend intermediate level knowledge of C programming.

## Talk to the community
Create and comment on issues to voice your opinion on the project.

## Set up your workspace
We use ANSI C (currently C11), so you need to have a compiler compatible with that syntax. We do not plan on
using any external libraries.

## Deal with the code
Pick an existing issue and comment on it saying you’re working on it. Ask for help if needed. Create a fork of the
project and do your work there.

## Submit your changes
When you’re done with your changes, create a pull request from your fork into the original repository.
